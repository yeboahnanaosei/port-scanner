# PORT SCANNER

### A simple PHP command line script that allows you to scan your system for open ports



### USAGE

* Download the script and put somewhere in your file system
* The script requires 3 (three) arguments to run: a host address, a starting port and an ending port



#### Example:

Assuming you have the script in your downloads folder, just navigate to the downloads folder and issue the following command:

`php port_scanner.php localhost 1 5000`

This will scan `localhost` starting from port number `1` to port number `5000`

After the scan is done, a report of all open ports found will be displayed on the screen.
